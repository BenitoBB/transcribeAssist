# **App Name**: TranscribeAssist

## Core Features:

- Real-time Transcription: Transcribe audio from class lectures into text in real time using a free speech-to-text API, such as the one offered in the Web Speech API.
- Multi-user Support: Allow multiple students to connect and view the same transcription feed.
- Speaker Identification: Implement basic speaker identification to differentiate between speakers in the transcription (e.g., Professor, Student 1, Student 2). An LLM tool may decide when to label the identified speaker.

- Text Highlighting and Notes: Enable users to highlight important sections of the text and add personal notes.
- Session Archiving: Automatically archive lecture transcriptions for future review. You may want to provide integrations with Google Drive, Dropbox, or box.com
